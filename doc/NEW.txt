In C++OPPS 2.2 this new feature has been added:

- a 3-sites FB model has been implemented, where diffusive dynamics of the
  FB1 model (global rotation + 1 dihedral angle) is coupled to a master
  equation for random jumps among 3 sites. Magnetic tensors can have different
  orientations in the three sites.
